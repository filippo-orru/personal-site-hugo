When I was in school, I used to play four in a row with a friend of mine. We kept our scores and were pretty even. During the first lockdown in April of 2020, I found myself with a lot of time to spare and started programming a version of Four in a Row with Flutter. First offering local versus, later expanding it to online multiplayer and adding extra features, like accounts, friends, CPU battle, chat and more.
