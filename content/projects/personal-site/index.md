*To start building a sort of online presence for myself, I built this personal website to showcase myself and my [recent projects]({{< ref "/projects" >}}).*

# Stack
- [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)  
  advertises itself as:
  > The world's fastest framework for building websites  

  and building this one sure did feel fast. It compiles an easy-to-manage libary of `.md` files into a static html website that can be served with lightning speed. Saving this file and seeing it refresh in the browser happens in less than 10 milliseconds.
- [Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder)  
  A minimal theme for Hugo which I adapted to my needs.

I recently updated my site's theme with some expressive new fonts and delighting animations. Read more about that [here]({{< ref "/projects/updating-site-theme" >}})
