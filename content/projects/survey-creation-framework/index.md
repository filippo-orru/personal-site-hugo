I built a survey creation framework as my fifth semester finals project. The project was part of my work at [Studo](https://studo.com/) and I was happy to be able to join work and my studies.

The final product will be used by company partners of Studo who publish their posts on the Studo Newsfeed. Studo is a student companion app that gives easy access to one's university services, calendar, grades, chat and much more.

The survey tool is integrated into the Studo Newsroom architecture and allows us and our company partners to create surveys, which can then be published to the Studo Newsfeed and filled out by students. Check out this article with [more info about the survey creation framework]({{< ref "/projects/survey-creation-framework" >}}). To analyze its performance, I will pit it against other solutions like [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com/) and [SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/).
