My name's Filippo and I'm currently {{< age-years 2001-07-25 />}} years old. This is my hub for showcasing my latest personal projects, blog articles, and attempts at art.

## Hobbies & interests
I usually live in Graz, Austria but now that I'm done with my Bachelor's degree, I'm working remotely from Southeast Asia for five months. I started in November 2022 and will be back by March 2023. When I'm not working, I like to go rock climbing, code my personal projects, and go out with friends. 


## Experience

I started at [Studo](https://studo.com/en/) in 2020 as a **Fullstack Software Engineer**, working on new features for all parts of the Studo ecosystem. As time passed, I grew within the company and received more responsibilities. These include the roles of **Project Lead Developer**, handling project communication with selected clients, and **Head of User Support**. Thanks to the trust placed in me and the variety of roles, I was able to improve my skills in many different areas and gain new expertise.

The Studo App is used by more than 300 thousand students across Europe and integrates all university services and information (calendar, grades, courses & more) into one place. Studo also works with universities to bring processes like *attendance tracking* to the digital age.


#### Mobile App Development
Native Android and iOS development using Kotlin and Swift respectively. Flutter for beautiful cross-platform apps.

- I worked on extending the app's mail client to support authentication via OAuth. Includes Azure app registration, authorization via web view, refresh token handling, error recovery, and adaptation of the existing mail problem diagnosis.

- We created a digital student card in a one-week hackathon. My main focus was to implement a holographic verification effect using layered canvas drawing and the device's gyroscope sensors.

- The app is monetized via a freemium model. Free users see in-app banner ads and I was tasked with the integration of a new third-party ads SDK. 

- In 2020 I developed a game using Flutter and published it on the Play Store. This taught me so much about the following topics.
    - Mobile development with Flutter, including advanced state handling and animations.
    - UI/UX design.
    - Networking, reconnection handling, ensuring stable connections.
    - Writing a resilient and authoritative game server in Rust.
    - Publishing an app on the Play Store, achieving over 5500 downloads.
    - Gathering user feedback.
    - CI/CD to improve my own developer experience.

#### Modern Web Development
Kotlin, React, JavaScript, and Elm.

As my biggest project, I created a custom survey creation platform and then wrote my thesis about it. [Read more about the survey creator]({{< ref "/blog/bachelor-thesis" >}}).


#### Backend Services and Databases
Kotlin, Rust, MongoDB, Ktor.

We were contracted by the [Unversity of Applied Sciences Campus02](https://en.campus02.at/) to create a digital attendance tracking solution. As part of this, I developed a service that syncs all data between the campus management system and Microsoft Teams. This included the following.
- Ongoing communication with our client. Reacting to their wishes and bug reports.
- Writing a custom wrapper for the MS Graph API featuring easy authentication, rate limiting, exponential backoff, and more.
- Knowing when to ask for help from senior coworkers.


#### Head of User Support

I am in charge of coordinating first, second, and third-level support. I investigate challenging cross-project issues when they come up, and bring in my coworkers' expertise to ensure our users are happy. As the number of developers and support team members grew, I introduced new processes, regarding ticket assignment, hand-off, and inter-team communication.


#### Interpersonal

As it turned out, there is much more than coding that makes a great Software Engineer. I learned how to communicate effectively with coworkers, across teams, and with clients. This was great for my personal growth.

I am also partly responsible for hiring and onboarding new developers. This entails coding interviews, decision-making and mentorship. I helped introduce many current developers to our tech stack and conventions.
