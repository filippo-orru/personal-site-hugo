Heyo! My name's Filippo and I'm currently {{< age-years 2001-07-25 />}} years old. This is my hub for showcasing my latest personal projects, blog articles and attempts at art.

## Hobbies & interests
In my free time, I like to go climbing or work on my own dev projects. Usually, I live in Graz, Austria but now that I'm done with my Bachelor's degree, I'm on a trip to south-east Asia for 4.5 months. I started in November 2022 and will be back by March 2023.

When I'm not working, programming or bouldering, I'm out with friends or playing badminton. 

Want an app suggestion? I like using [Harmonic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simon.harmonichackernews&hl=en) to browse hacker news.
