This is my hub for showcasing my latest personal projects and blog articles.

## Hobbies & interests
In my free time, I like to go indoor climbing or work on my own dev projects. I'm currently {{< age-years 2001-07-25 />}} years ({{< age-hours-seconds 2001-07-25 />}}) old and live in Graz, Austria. Now that I'm done with my Bachelor's degree, I'm currently on a trip to south-east Asia for four and a half months, from November 2022 until March 2023.

When I'm not working, programming or bouldering, I'm usually out with friends or playing badminton. 

Want an app suggestion? I like using [Harmonic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simon.harmonichackernews&hl=en) to browse hacker news.
