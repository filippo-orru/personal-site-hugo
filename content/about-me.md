This is my hub for showcasing my latest personal projects and blog articles.

## Hobbies & interests
In my free time, I like to go indoor climbing or work on my own dev projects. I'm currently 20 years ({{< age-hours-seconds 2001-07-25 />}}) old and live in Graz, Austria. Once I'm done with my Bachelor's degree in July 2022, I'm planning to go on a trip to south-east Asia -- I'm a living cliché, I know :)

When I'm not working, programming or bouldering, I'm usually out with friends or playing badminton.
