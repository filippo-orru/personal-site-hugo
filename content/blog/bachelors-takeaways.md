As my studies are drawing to a close, I took some time to reflect about the past two and a half years. In October of 2019, I moved from Germany to Graz, Austria and started studying [Mobile Software Development](https://www.fh-joanneum.at/mobile-software-development/bachelor/en/) at the university of applied sciences [FH Joanneum](https://fh-joanneum.at/en/). 

Now the only thing left is to write my Bachelor's thesis. Last semester, I created a survey creation framework as part of my work at [Studo](https://studo.com/). Studo is a student companion app that gives you easy access to your study calendar, grades, chat and much more. 

The survey tool is integrated into the Studo Newsroom architecture and allows us and our company partners to create surveys, which can then be published to the Studo Newsfeed and filled out by students. Check out this article with [more info about the survey creation framework]({{< ref "/projects/survey-creation-framework" >}}). To analyze its performance, I will pit it against other solutions like [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com/) and [SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/).
