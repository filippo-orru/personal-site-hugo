# Other
- ‚ùóÔ∏è Passport \
  make sure it's valid for >6 months!! I forgot this and almost got into lots of trouble.
- Local currency \
  At my local bank, I exchanged 200‚Ç¨ into Thai Baht before flying. Saves you from having to buy at poor airport exchange rates.
- Credit card(s) \
  Both Visa & Mastercard. Yes, we've had cases where one didn't work. I recommend N26 because the credit card is free and they charge no fees when paying in foreign currencies and only charge 1.7% when withdrawing them.
- Backpack: Osprey Farpoint Trek 75L \
  &rarr; awesome and comfy, fits all my stuff. Also includes a rain cover / travel cover for protecting it during flight handling.
