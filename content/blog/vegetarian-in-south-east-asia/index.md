While writing this, I'm one month into traveling through south-east Asia. Started in Thailand, flew from Bangkok to a city in the north and then crossed over to Laos, where I visited three cities. I've recently arrived in Hanoi, Vietnam and am on my way to the countryside. During my time traveling, I've been through large and small cities, good and bad weather, great and lackluster foods. Mostly it's been an awesome trip though.

Back home in Graz, Austria, the city offers so many great restaurants and street food places to choose from. Almost all of them offer decent vegetarian options, and some even only serve plant-based food. My expectations were sky-high! I was going to be trying many different local foods, discover new tastes and combinations. In my (naive?) mind, I thought that meat-free dishes would be the default choice when traveling in south-east Asia where people have such different cultures and the income-level is lower.

What I want to write about is how unexpectedly hard it's been to find decent *vegetarian* food.  Arriving in Bangkok, my expectations were contradicted. Almost all street food was based around meat, many places didn't offer a single vegetarian dish, even including restaurants in the popular tourist streets. For the first days, my saviour was vegetable pad thai, while I dreamed of the varied and healthy foods I was used to.
