I like keyboards. That's why I spent 400€ building a split keyboard for my job as a software developer, I've posted about it [here]({{< ref "/blog/lily58" >}}) (also includes pictures). 

When it comes to customization, it's pretty far from a normal QWERTY keyboard. The keys are blank, I use the [Bone 2 layout](https://neo-layout.org/Layouts/bone/), and I've modified the board's [QMK firmware](https://qmk.fm/), so I can control the mouse using special arrow keys.

**But in this post, I won't talk about any of these "advanced" customizations.** Instead, here's a cheat sheet with the 36 keyboard shortcuts I've found most useful for my work as a developer. If you prefer the web version instead of a printable PDF, check it out on [cheatography.com](https://cheatography.com/filippo-orru/cheat-sheets/useful-shortcuts-for-developers/).

{{< notice "warning" "Please note" >}}
Some shortcuts only apply to MacOS and IntelliJ IDEA, since that's what we use at [Studo](https://studo.com/en).

I've highlighted the shortcuts I find most valuable or underused with a star. 
Shortcuts marked with an asterisk have been remapped from their default in IntelliJ. To do that, open settings by pressing `⌘ + ,`, navigate to *Keymap*, and search for the command you wish to remap.

As always, you should balance the time you spend optimizing something, versus using it ([xkcd 1205](https://xkcd.com/1205)). Some people might waste their lives in pursuit of the perfect Emacs configuration ([watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/urcL86UpqZc?si=VYbFVhACCos-ZbNv)), but never actually use it to code. \
But I believe that **people making a living using a computer ought to invest some time into learning how to use it efficiently** and ergonomically. And as a bonus, you might reduce your risk of Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI).
