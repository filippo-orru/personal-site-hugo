The topic for 2023's covers is `aerial shots`.

{{< notice question "Playlist Covers" >}}
I've been creating one playlist with my favorite music every month for the past {{< age-years 2018-07-01 >}} years. As the month goes on, I add songs that strike a chord with me (hehe). On average, they contain around 10 songs, but that varies a lot depending on how much time I can dedicate to actively listening to music.
