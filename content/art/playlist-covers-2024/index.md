The topic for 2024's covers is `pretty patterns`.

{{< notice type="question" title="Playlist Covers" raw=true >}}
I've been creating one playlist with my favorite music every month for the past {{< age-years date="2018-07-01" >}} years. As the month goes on, I add songs that strike a chord with me (hehe). On average, they contain around 10 songs, but that varies a lot depending on how much time I can dedicate to actively listening to music.

Last year's topic was `aerial shots`, check it out [here]({{< ref "/art/playlist-covers-2023" >}}), or see all [playlist covers]({{< ref "/series/playlist-covers" >}}).

I really like this tradition of mine, and a positive side effect is that I strongly associate the songs of a given playlist with the events and memories of that month. For example, hearing [Space Ghost Coast To Coast](https://open.spotify.com/track/4mjV2VrBj1vAOV8dFlXs7i?si=30136268d9f44b11) by Glass Animals takes me back to May 2021, when I listened to the song a lot while on holiday in Italy. You can listen to the whole playlist here:

As you can see, the covers used to look quite different.
